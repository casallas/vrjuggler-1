 * data types. This default implementation stores every data sample received

 * It is up to individual implementations to determine how to handle the
 * \c consumed variable. This default implementation effectively ignores it.
 *
 * @tparam EventTag The tag identifying the kind of event. This is used to
 *                  provide a mechanism for specializing this type based on
 *                  specific needs.
